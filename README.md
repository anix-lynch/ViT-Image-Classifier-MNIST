## 🖼️ Vision Transformer for Image Classification on MNIST

In this project, we’ll fine-tune a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model to classify images from the **MNIST** dataset using **transfer learning**. We’ll leverage the **Transformers** library to download and fine-tune a pretrained model, and use **Matplotlib** for data visualization and **scikit-learn** for model evaluation. Ready to explore ViT for image classification? Let’s go! 🚀📷

## Project Overview

We’ll be working with the **MNIST** dataset, which contains images of single digits (0-9), to build an image classifier using the **Vision Transformer (ViT)**. Our goal is to load and preprocess the dataset, fine-tune a pretrained ViT model, and evaluate the model’s performance using the **F1 score**.

We’ll begin by loading the dataset from the **Hugging Face Hub** using the **Datasets** library and visualizing the images with **Matplotlib**. After data preprocessing and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, we’ll download a pretrained ViT model from Hugging Face and fine-tune it for our image classification task. We’ll wrap up the project by evaluating the model with metrics from **scikit-learn**.
